# AI Programming with Python Nanodegree Program

In this repo, I will cover all aspects and give a feedback for the AI Programming with Python Nanodegree from Udacity.

## Overview
This program focuses on the fundamental building blocks you will need to learn in order to become an AI practitioner. Specifically, you will learn programming skills, and essential math for building an AI
architecture. You’ll even dive into neural networks and deep learning.

One of our main goals at Udacity is to help you create a job-ready portfolio. Building a project is one of the best ways to test the skills you’ve acquired, and to demonstrate your newfound abilities to prospective
employers. In this Nanodegree program you will test your ability to use a pre-trained neural network architecture, and also have the opportunity to prove your skills by building your own image classifier.

In the sections below, you’ll find detailed descriptions of the projects, along with the course material that presents the skills required to complete them.

## Course 1: Introduction to Python
Start coding with Python, drawing upon libraries and automation scripts to solve complex problems quickly.
